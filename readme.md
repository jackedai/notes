## Introduction
This is largely inspired by [Jeremy Howards fastai/fastbook](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook.git), I need a place to keep my notes as I learn new language and library features. Jupyter fulfills all my needs and integrates accross many platforms.

Advantages:
+ Can run code and make changes in my notes to quickly remember how features work
+ Plays nicely with GitHub so versioning is taken care of, and I always have a place to view my notes no matter the environment
+ IntelliJ Jupyter and IdeaVim play excellent together making it a very nice editing experience, has grammar checking, autocomplete and endless other useful features
+ Can be exported to many formats, fitting many use cases e.g. documentation, textbooks 
+ There are over 100 language kernels
+ jupyter-lab has some very usefull plugins like auto contents

Disadvantage:
+ I previously kept notes in VimWiki where I used a hotkey to bring up my notes quickly, could use tab to cycle through hyperlinks, enter to quickly create a new document, and backspace to go back a page. My workflow is slowed a little by manually opening documents.
